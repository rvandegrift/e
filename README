Enlightenment

Requirements:
-------------

Must:
  efl elementary
  libc libm libX11 libXext
  xcb xcb-shape xcb-keysyms

Heavily suggested:
  evas_generic_loaders (all loaders)

NOTE: Users of DR16 will need to rename the $prefix/bin/enlightenment
file prior to installing this release or it will be overwritten.

MESON BUILD:
	meson . build
optional:
	mesonconf --options OR meson configure --options

	cd build && sudo ninja install

AUTOTOOLS BUILD:
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local/e
	sudo make install

You will, as usual, need to add the subsequent bin dir to your $PATH etc.


NOTES:

* if you do not want security issues make sure sysactions.conf is in
/etc/enlightenment (not PREFIX/etc/enlightenment) as this is the first place
it looks at. This file is intended to be customized by packagers and
system integrators to match your policies and scripts/tools.
