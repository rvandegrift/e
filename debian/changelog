e17 (0.16.999.050+svn20081207-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Upstream SVN snapshot
    - build-depend and make efl-dev depend on libeina-0.0.1a-dev
  * Update {build,}dependencies to match the new EFL packages name
  * Ship enlightenment.pc instead of enlightenment-config, as the latter is
    now deprecated (Closes: #504293)
  * Build-Depend on libasound2-dev to get the mixer module working
    - Closes: #506847
  * Make e17 depend on libedje-bin as this is necessary for e.g. changing the
    background.
  * No longer remove the wizard module from the package, as it is now usable
  * Add debian/patches/02_fix_default_config_for_upgrades.diff:
    - Add buttons for halt/shutdown/etc to the syscon module for the default
      profile. Without that, users upgrading from older versions would have an
      empty 'system' menu
  * debian/patches/01_install_internal-use_binaries_in_usr_lib_enlightenment.diff:
    - update, as a new binary going in /usr/lib/enlightenment was introduced
  * lintian fixes:
    - add ${misc:Depends} to dependencies
    - remove e17-data.lintian-overrides, no longer needed
    - Add overrides about setuid root programs to e17.lintian-overrides

  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.0
  * patch 01_install_internal-use_binaries_in_usr_lib_enlightenment.diff :

  * Bump B-D on debhelper to 6.0.7 to be sure to get dh_lintian
  * Fix typo in README.Debian. (Closes: #495185)
