e17 (0.17.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The e17 release (0.17 and above) introduces incompatible changes to the
  configuration files used by Enlightenment. When restarting after an upgrade
  from 0.16.999.x to 0.17, e17 will discard its previous configuration files.
  If you want to keep your previous configuration files, please make sure to
  make a backup of the ~/.e/e/config directory.

  It is not possible to copy the old files back in place and have e17 use
  them, however it is possible to extract previous and current configuration
  settings to try and merge previous settings:

  	eet -d input_config_file.cfg config output_file.txt

  and recreate them using:

  	eet -e output_config_file.cfg config input_file.txt 1
